GRMG is a simple, test version of an RPG game made using Pygame.
It was made as the final project for my final high school programming course.

BUGS ARE PRESENT, IT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

To run, just download the repo as a zip or clone it if you want to automatically get updates.

Requirements:
python 3.8.3+
pygame

To install pygame, once python is installed, (remember to check add to PATH during installation).
Open CMD and type:
pip install pygame

If python has not been added to the PATH environnement variable, follow a tutorial on how to add it to the PATH.

Have fun!
